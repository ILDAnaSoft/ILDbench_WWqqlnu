example.cpp explores the various statistics

run.sh makes the executable and analyses 5 data-sets 

(three toy MC ones - that are generated here, 
 and two provided reconstructed MC samples).

Not all statistics have been fully calibrated in terms of Gaussian consistency and 
small sample correction.
